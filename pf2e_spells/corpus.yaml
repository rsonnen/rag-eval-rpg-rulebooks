name: "Pathfinder 2e Spells"

corpus_context: >
  500 spells from Paizo's Pathfinder 2nd Edition, sourced from Archives of
  Nethys. Each document contains spell name, source, spell rank (level), traits
  (schools, descriptors like Chaotic/Evil), traditions (Arcane, Divine, Occult,
  Primal), components (somatic, verbal, material), targets, range, duration,
  and full description with save effects. PF2e spells use four degrees of
  success (critical success, success, failure, critical failure). Includes
  heightened versions for scaling effects. ORC license.

  spell_selection:
    name: "PF2e Spell Selection"
    description: >
      Player selecting spells for a PF2e character, filtering by tradition, rank,
      or effect type. Questions like "What rank 5 Divine tradition spells exist?"
      or "Find spells with the Disease trait." Tests filtering by PF2e's spell
      organization system which differs from D&D 5e.

  spell_mechanics:
    name: "Spell Mechanics Reference"
    description: >
      Looking up spell effects during play, particularly the four-degrees-of-success
      outcomes that PF2e uses. Questions like "What happens on a critical success
      against Abyssal Plague?" or "What are all the battle forms available in
      Animal Form?" Tests understanding of PF2e's detailed success/failure gradations.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      Questions with exact answers from spell text to verify retrieval accuracy.
      "What disease does Abyssal Plague inflict?" (Abyssal plague, level 9),
      "What is Animal Form's base duration?" (1 minute), "What traditions can
      cast Animal Form?" (Primal only). Tests accurate parsing of PF2e spell
      format and terminology.
