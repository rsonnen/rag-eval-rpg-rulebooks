  encounter_building:
    name: "PF2e Encounter Building"
    description: >
      GM building encounters using PF2e's creature level system. Questions like
      "What level 12 creatures have innate spellcasting?" or "Find creatures with
      regeneration that can be deactivated." Tests filtering by PF2e-specific
      mechanics like creature level, traits, and special abilities.

  creature_mechanics:
    name: "Creature Mechanics Reference"
    description: >
      Looking up PF2e-specific mechanics during play: action economy (single
      action, two actions), innate spell DCs, skill modifiers for specific checks,
      or creature trait implications. Questions like "What's the Kolyarut's spell
      DC?" or "What skills does the Kolyarut have bonuses in?" Tests navigation
      of PF2e's detailed stat block format.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      Factual questions with exact answers from PF2e stat blocks. "What is the
      Kolyarut's AC?" (34), "What is the Unseen Servant's creature level?" (-1),
      "What damage type is the Kolyarut weak to and for how much?" (chaotic 15).
      Verifies accurate parsing of PF2e's distinct stat block structure.
