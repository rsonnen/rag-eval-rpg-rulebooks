  spell_lookup:
    name: "Spell Lookup and Selection"
    description: >
      A player or DM searching for spells matching specific criteria: damage type,
      spell level, class availability, school of magic, or thematic elements.
      Queries might ask "What illusion spells deal psychic damage?" or "Find
      spells that create portals or teleportation effects." Tests retrieval of
      spells based on mechanical and thematic attributes.

  mechanics_reference:
    name: "Rules Clarification and Mechanics"
    description: >
      Testing whether the system can accurately retrieve specific mechanical
      details: exact damage dice, saving throw types, component costs,
      concentration requirements, and upcasting scaling. Questions like "What
      material component does Acid Gate require?" verify the system retrieved
      and parsed the actual document content.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      Questions with unambiguous answers found in specific spell documents.
      Tests whether the retrieval system found the right spell and whether the
      generation system correctly extracted details. Questions should have single
      correct answers: "What is the duration of Abhorrent Apparition?" or "How
      many creatures can use Acid Gate at base level?"
